# OpenGL Experiments

Messing around with a template from my Brooklyn College Graphics Course https://cisc3620.github.io/docs/

## Cloning and Building

*  git clone --recursive <THE_URL>
* cd into Build directory
* cmake -G "Xcode" .. (replace with whatever compiler you have if not on OSX)

Going to make a specific branch for specific 'experiments/sketches' and leave the master as the bare bones "hello triangle" template.

Starting to mess with GLSL stuff mainly from this great online book: https://thebookofshaders.com. The examples in the book are mainly for webGL, processing, and openFrameworks. So this repo could be of interest to anyone interested in doing similar things in "pure" openGL.
